# Document RAG Assistant

An AI-powered document question-answering system built using Python and FastAPI.

This project implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline where users can upload documents and ask natural language questions. The system retrieves relevant document context using semantic search and generates grounded responses using an LLM.
